### Core TODO:

1. Needs to accept a deck list from the user

	   - Needs to track the name and set number of each card
	   - Needs to track the type and subtype of each card
	   - Needs to assign special functionality to certain cards

2. Needs to accept data on what cards need to be drawn each turn

3. Needs to accept data on whether a supporter is played on a specific turn

4. Needs to simulate drawing from a deck

	   - Has to keap track of whether requirments specified by the user are sucessful
	   - Shuffling
	   - Deck, Hand, and discard zone

### Good to Have

	- Accept data on and simulate turn order
	- Accept data on and simulate energy color
	- HTML interface to make inputing card traits easier
	- Database of cards
