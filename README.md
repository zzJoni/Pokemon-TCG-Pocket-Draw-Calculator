This is a project where you can enter a deck list and a set of conditions 
(ei: what cards to draw on which turns) and generate the aproximate probability of that happening.

This probability will be calculated by repeatedly similating drawing cards for the deck and assesing how frequently
the specified conditions are met

Right now, this program will be run soley in terminal, but later on, an html interface might be impliented
